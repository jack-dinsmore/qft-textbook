\chapter{Lattice Quantum Field Theory}

The past few chapters dealt with connecting observables such as scattering amplitudes and particle creation to the $n$-point correlation functions. The most common way to actually evaluate these functions is to use the perturbative techniques discussed in the rest of this book, but in this chapter we briefly mention the alternative methods in case the perturbative approach should fail.
