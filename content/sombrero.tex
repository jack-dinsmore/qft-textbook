\chapter{Sombrero Theory}

\section{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}

\section{Massless decay?}

I would do this (1) if the sombrero model actually has $\theta\rightarrow \theta\theta$ decay, and (2) if this section weren't already too huge (because I could also put it in $\phi^3$)\footnote{https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9508018.pdf}.
