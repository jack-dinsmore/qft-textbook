# Perturbative Quantum Field Theory

I'm a PhD student studying physics at Stanford University. This is my work-in progress quantum field theory textbook, intended for people who are curious about the phenomena, intuition, and mathematical methods behind quantum field theory and particle physics. 

DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert in quantum field theory. I was only a first year grad student at the time I started this book, and  my field is astrophysics. I'm writing this book as an exercise to help me remember and understand quantum field theory better because I think it's a particularly unique and beautiful branch of physics. I hope this book evokes the same fascination in QFT in others that it did in me, but please remember that it is by no means authoritative. See the references section for more deserving resources on QFT.

Due to the working nature of this book, it is liable to be updated without warning and corrected errata will not be tracked. Edit history is always visible in the commit statements. Please forgive typos or absurd wording. I wrote much of this book at midnight.

* _Quantum Field Theory_ by Mark Srednicki
  - This book is much more concise than Peskin & Schroeder or my book, though it focuses less on physical intuition

  - This is a technical book intended for experts, containing experimental verifications of the standard model and very good review papers on standard model theory.
